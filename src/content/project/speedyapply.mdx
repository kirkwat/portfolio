## Implementation Details

#### Technologies: TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Zod

Vite, in conjunction with the CRXJS Vite plugin, was utilized to develop this Chrome extension, enabling efficient creation and optimization of the project during the development process.

CI/CD was integrated into the project workflow through the adoption of Semantic Release and GitHub Actions, enabling streamlined automation and deployment processes. Pull requests underwent build checks to ensure successful compilation before being permitted to merge into the main branch. Semantic Release automated versioning and changelog generation while also publishing compiled Chrome extension versions to the Chrome Web Store.

### Chrome Extension Components

- Popup Window: Provides users with convenient access to essential pages, easy tracking of daily application count, and a quick toggle option to enable/disable autofill scripts.

- Options Tab: Offers a comprehensive interface for users to view completed applications, create/edit job profile, and configure autofill settings, providing centralized control and enhanced customization capabilities.

- Content Script: Implements autofill scripts to seamlessly populate forms and input fields, streamlining the application process.

- Storage: Utilizes the Chrome Storage API to store the job profile, extension settings, and completed applications.
  The user retains complete control and confidence over their information as it is securely stored on their local machine.

## Next Steps

Features that I plan to implement in the future include:

- Autofill support for more application portals.
- GPT API integration to suggest responses for open-ended questions.
- Enhance application analysis with more filters and visual data representation.
- Possibly open source to expand features and customization options.
