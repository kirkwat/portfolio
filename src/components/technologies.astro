    <p class="mt-4 text-left">
      I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Computer
      Science, Data Science, and Mathematics at Southern Methodist University.
      My objective is to obtain a full-time position with a business that
      compliments my degree plan and passion for software development. I am
      eager to join a forward-thinking organization where I can leverage my
      educational background, demonstrate my adaptability, produce high-quality
      deliverables, and collaborate effectively with a diverse team. At this
      time, I am actively seeking full-time software engineering opportunities
      for when I graduate in May 2024.
